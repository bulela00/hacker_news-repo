# hacker_news-repo

In this project we are working with a dataset of submissions (posts) to Hacker News. Hacker News is a popular technology site, similar to reddit, where posts receive votes and comments. 
The objective of this project is to determine: 
- whether the Ask HN or the Show HN posts receive more comments on average.
- whether posts created times receive more comments on average
